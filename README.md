# eTCG Subcategories

Whether you're using mass decks or getting creative, you can use this to separate one category into different places. This script will also display pending cards.

1. Copy and paste [this script](https://github.com/savwiley/etcg-Subcategories/blob/main/subs.php) into your mods file.

2. Insert this wherever you want your new subcategory to appear: 
```
<?php show_massSubcats('TCG', 'CATEGORY', array('DECK1', 'DECK2')); ?>
```

Add as many decks as you want. There is room for error with this script (typos, forgetting decks, etc) and there's some work to install it depending on how large your categories will be, not to mention the need to update it every time new decks are released. However, this does allow for some easier customization, especially with large mass decks.

Have fun!
